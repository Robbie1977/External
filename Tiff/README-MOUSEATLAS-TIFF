VERSION MRC HGU $Id$

Some Mouse Atlas software depends on a tiff library, the source of which
is contained in the gzip compressed tar archive file. To build and install
the library:
  1. Untar the tiff source. Using GNU tar this can be done simply by:
       gtar -zxf tiff-3.8.2.tar.gz
  2. Change directory into the untared source directory:
       cd tiff-3.8.2
  3. Configure the software using /opt/MouseAtlas as the root of the Mouse
     Atlas software tree:
       ./configure --prefix=/opt/MouseAtlas
  4. Build the software:
       make
  5. Test where it will be installed:
       make -n install
  6. Having the appropriate file permissions, install the software:
       make install
