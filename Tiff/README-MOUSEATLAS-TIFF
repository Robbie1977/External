VERSION MRC HGU $Id$

Some Mouse Atlas software depends on a tiff library, the source of which
is contained in the gzip compressed tar archive file. To build and install
the library:
  1. Untar the tiff source. Using GNU tar this can be done simply by:
       gtar -zxf tiff-v3.5.7.tar.gz
  2. Change directory into the untared source directory:
       cd tiff-v3.5.7
  3. Set the OPTIMIZER environment variable for your C compiler. Using
     Sun's compiler and a tcsh or csh shell, then the following is
     appropriate:
       setenv OPTIMIZER '-fast -xchip=ultra'
     For the GNU C compiler use:
       setenv OPTIMIZER '-O3'
  4. Configure the software to build using your C compiler and install in
     the Mouse Atlas software tree. Using cc as the compiler and
     /opt/MouseAtlas as the root of the Mouse Atlas software tree, then
     the following is appropriate:
       ./configure --prefix=/opt/MouseAtlas -with-CC=cc
     The configure script is interactive and will want it's configuration
     to be verified.
  5. Build the software:
       make
  6. Test where it will be installed:
       make -n install
  7. Having the appropriate file permissions, install the software:
       make install
