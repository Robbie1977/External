VERSION MRC IGMM $Id$

Some Mouse Atlas software depends on a jpeg library. On many systems
there is already a suitable jpeg library installed. Where this is not
the case a jpeg library may be built from the sources contained in the
gzip compressed tar archive file in this directory. To build and install
the library:
  1. Untar the jpeg source. Using GNU tar this can be done simply by:
       tar -zxf jpeg-6b.tar.gz
  2. Change directory into the untared source directory:
       cd jpeg-6b
  3. Set the CC and CFLAGS environment variables for your C compiler, eg:
       setenv CC gcc ; setenv CFLAGS '-O3'
  4. Configure the software to build using your C compiler and install in
     the Mouse Atlas software tree:
       setenv MA /opt/MouseAtlas (or if using sh export MA=/opt/MouseAtlas)
       ./configure --prefix=$MA
  5. Build the software:
       make -j4
  6. The makefile doesn't install the library or includes (which are
     what is wanted). Do this using:
       cp libjpeg.a $MA/lib/
       cp *.h $MA/include/
