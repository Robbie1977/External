Some Mouse Atlas software depends on a jpeg library. On many systems
there is already a suitable jpeg library installed. Where this is not
the case a jpeg library may be built from the sources contained in the
gzip compressed tar archive file in this directory. To build and install
the library:
  1. Untar the jpeg source. Using GNU tar this can be done simply by:
       gtar -zxf jpeg-6b.tar.gz
  2. Change directory into the untared source directory:
       cd jpeg-6b
  3. Set the CC and CFLAGS environment variables for your C compiler.
     Using Sun's compiler and a tcsh or csh shell, then the following is
     appropriate:
       setenv CC cc; setenv CFLAGS '-fast -xchip=ultra'
     For the GNU C compiler use:
       setenv CC gcc; setenv CFLAGS '-O3'
  4. Configure the software to build using your C compiler and install in
     the Mouse Atlas software tree. Using cc as the compiler and
     /opt/MouseAtlas as the root of the Mouse Atlas software tree, then
     the following is appropriate:
       ./configure --prefix=/opt/MouseAtlas
  5. Build the software:
       make
  6. Test where it will be installed:
       make -n install
  7. Having the appropriate file permissions, install the software:
       make install
