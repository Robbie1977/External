This is a convinient packaging of software required to build and run some
of the Mouse Atlas software. To build and install the software follow the
instructions in the README files along side the archive files in each
of the directories. In many cases and particularly on Linux systems these
README files can be edited and run as shell scripts to build and install
the software.

The software libraries in the order that they should be built and installed
are:
