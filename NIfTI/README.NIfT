To build the NIfTI c library.

1. Unpack the sources:
     tar -zxf nifticlib-2.0.0.tar.gz
2. Optionally, configure using either cmake or cmake-gui with the build directory the
   same as the source directory (nifticlib-2.0.0):
     cmake-gui
     or
     cmake -i
3. Build the libs:
     cd nifticlib-2.0.0
     make all
